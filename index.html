              Alright, before we get started, let me talk for a moment about the format here. I set this up as a
              workshop because, if you're anything like me, my eyes start to glaze over during long presentations with
              lots of slides because it's just too much to take in all at once. I learn a lot better (and faster) from
              just getting hands-on with new tech.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, to set expectations, there are still going to be a ton of slides and content that I will be going over
              rather quickly - in about 30 minutes. My recommendation is to NOT take notes during the presentation. That
              may sound crazy, but, by the time you finish writing your note, I'll likely be 2 slides ahead. This whole
              presentation is available on my public GitHub, so you can always refer to the content later and take notes
              at your own pace without having to feel rushed.
            </p>
            <p>Alright, let's go ahead and get started!</p>

                This is definitely one of my favorite photos that I've taken. This is from a 2 week trip back in March
                of 2022 where I got to explore both upper and lower Egypt. I even took a cruise down the Nile! It was a
                phenonemal experience that I recommend everyone have on their bucket list!

              <p>Who knows which pyramid this is?</p>

                When you think of Egypt, you probably think of these 3 main pryamids on the Giza plateau. These are the
                Pyramid of Menkaure, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Khufu, also known as the Great Pyramid.
              </p>
              <p>You didn't know you were in for an Egypt lesson, huh?</p>
              <p>
                The ancient Egyptians demonstrated exceptional precision in their construction methods, most notably
                seen in the building of the pyramids at Giza, where massive stone blocks fit together with minimal gaps,
                showcasing their advanced understanding of geometry, precise measurements, and meticulous planning.

              <p>Wait! What does this have to do with Nx?</p>
              <p>Well, you don't build any pyramids without a plan, and the ability to execute on that plan, right?</p>
              <p><strong>Quarrying Process</strong> - extracting stones from the bedrock.</p>
              <p><strong>Rough Shaping and Cutting</strong> - make the stone as small as possible for transport.</p>
              <p><strong>Transportation</strong> - the king's chamber rose granite came from Aswan, 560 miles away.</p>
              <p><strong>Stone Cutting and Fitting</strong> - preparing stone blocks to be installed onsite.</p>
              <p><strong>Installation and Finishing</strong> - lift and set the stones in place.</p>
              <p>
                At the end of the day, the process of building a pyramid is not much different than the process of
                building a modern enterprise system. You need a strong, level foundation to build from that can support
                the eventual growth and complexity that will come.
              </p>
              <p>That's what Nx provides!</p>
              <p>
                Modern enterprise systems are made up of hundreds, if not thousands, of individual blocks, or, modules.
                Each of those modules must be composed together into a single cohesive experience for the end user.

              A feature library contains a set of files that configure a business use case or a page in an application.
              Most of the components in such a library are container components that interact with data sources. This

                different abstraction levels - from high-level architecture down to specific implementation details.
