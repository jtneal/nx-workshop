              This is definitely one of my favorite photos that I've taken. This is from a 2 week trip back in March of
              2022 where I got to explore both upper and lower Egypt. I even took a cruise down the Nile! It was a
              phenonemal experience that I recommend everyone have on their bucket list!

            <p>Who knows which pyramid this is?</p>
            <p>You didn't think there would be a pop quiz, huh?</p>
            <p>The Pyramid of Khafre!</p>

            <p>
              When you think of Egypt, you probably think of these 3 main pryamids on the Giza plateau. These are the
              Pyramid of Menkaure, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Khufu, also known as the Great Pyramid.
            </p>
            <p>You didn't know you were in for an Egypt lesson, huh?</p>
            <p>
              The ancient Egyptians demonstrated exceptional precision in their construction methods, most notably seen
              in the building of the pyramids at Giza, where massive stone blocks fit together with minimal gaps,
              showcasing their advanced understanding of geometry, precise measurements, and meticulous planning.

            <p>Wait! What does this have to do with Nx?</p>
            <p>Well, you don't build any pyramids without a plan, and the ability to execute on that plan, right?</p>
            <p><strong>Quarrying Process</strong> - extracting stones from the bedrock.</p>
            <p><strong>Rough Shaping and Cutting</strong> - make the stone as small as possible for transport.</p>
            <p><strong>Transportation</strong> - the king's chamber rose granite came from Aswan, 560 miles away.</p>
            <p><strong>Stone Cutting and Fitting</strong> - preparing stone blocks to be installed onsite.</p>
            <p><strong>Installation and Finishing</strong> - lift and set the stones in place.</p>
            <p>
              At the end of the day, the process of building a pyramid is not much different than the process of
              building a modern enterprise system. You need a strong, level foundation to build from that can support
              the eventual growth and complexity that will come.
            </p>
            <p>That's what Nx provides!</p>
            <p>
              Modern enterprise systems are made up of hundreds, if not thousands, of individual blocks, or, modules.
              Each of those modules must be composed together into a single cohesive experience for the end user.

            <p>What is Nx?</p>
            <p>
              Nx is an extensible open-source dev tool that helps teams develop at scale by providing 3 main things:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>1.</strong> Out of the box configuration of frameworks and modern tools so that you can focus more
              on your application and less on configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2.</strong> Easily share your code across multiple applications or teams, while enforcing clean
              integration points.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3.</strong> Understand the dependency graph of your codebase, so that you can run tests or other
              actions on exactly the areas affected by a PR, and no more.
            </p>
